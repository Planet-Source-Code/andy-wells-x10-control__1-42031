There are two things you need to run this program:
	X10 Receiver and a module of some sort.  (Look at X10.com)
	CM17A Firecracker ActiveX Control from http://www.keware.com/download.htm
	Put the CM17A file in the directory of the code.

Once you have those two things, you should be ready to go!

I wanted to create a program like this, and I couldn't until I found the submission from
Andrew Mathiason.  From his program I learned how to do it.  I didn't copy and code from his 
program.  I just learned through it.  Enjoy!
